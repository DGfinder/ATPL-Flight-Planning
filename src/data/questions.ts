    description: "Refer B727 Flight Manual Extract, ERC H3 and RSWT Extract. You are planning a flight from DARWIN (YPDN) to MELBOURNE (YMML) via A461 and H119. You have the following planning data: Ramp weight 83250 kg, Cruise level FL330, TMN 0.82. Enroute overhead ALICE SPRINGS (YBAS), Gross weight is 74630 kg. DARWIN is SUITABLE, MELBOURNE and ALICE SPRINGS are ACCEPTABLE, but may be considered SUITABLE if 30 minutes holding fuel is carried. You calculate the ALICE SPRINGS to MELBOURNE CP/DP to be 6 nm south of LEIGH CREEK (YLEC). Your calculation of the total fuel required to be on board at engine start, to cover depressurisation at the CP/DP, is closest to -",
