# Supabase Integration Setup

## Database Schema
Your Supabase database is configured with the following tables:
- `questions` - AFPA exam questions with aviation-specific data
- `user_progress` - Individual question attempts and scores
- `study_sessions` - Study session tracking and analytics
- `profiles` - User profiles with student information
- `question_sets` - Custom question collections
- `flight_plan_templates` - Flight planning sheet templates

## Authentication
The app supports user authentication with:
- Email/password signup and login
- User profiles with student ID and institution
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

## Local Development

### 1. Database Population
After signing up a user, populate the database with questions:

```typescript
// In browser console after signup/login:
await populateQuestions();
await verifyQuestions();
```

### 2. Testing the Integration
1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Verify cloud sync indicator appears
4. Answer questions and check they persist across sessions
5. Test offline fallback by disabling network

### 3. Question Migration
The app automatically:
- Loads questions from Supabase when authenticated
- Falls back to local sample questions when offline
- Syncs progress to both cloud and localStorage as backup

## Features
✅ **Dual Mode Operation**: Works online (Supabase) and offline (localStorage)
✅ **Real-time Sync**: Progress synced to cloud immediately
✅ **Session Tracking**: Study sessions recorded with analytics
✅ **User Profiles**: Student information and progress tracking
✅ **Aviation Calculations**: Proper tolerance-based grading
✅ **Course Notes**: PDF viewing with OCR text extraction

## Database Status
- Questions: Ready for population via `populateQuestions()`
- Authentication: Fully configured with RLS
- Progress Tracking: Implemented with real-time sync
- Session Management: Active session tracking enabled
